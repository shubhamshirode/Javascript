    <h2>Prime Number</h2>
    <p>The Number which is only Divisible by 1 and itself.</p>
    <pre>
        0 ,1 & negative numbers are not prime number, so use num is less then 2 for it.
        i=2 because from 2 we have to chek that number is divisible or not,
        if number is divisible by 2 then it is not prime number.....

        i is less then number because number is divisible by itself.
    </pre>

    <script>

        let num = parseInt(prompt("Enter the Number"));
        if(num < 2){
            console.log("It is Not Prime Number");
        }
        else{
            let flag = 0;
            let i = 2;

            while(i<num){
                if(num%i==0){
                    flag = 1;
                    break;
                }
                i++;
            }
            if(flag == 0){
                console.log("It is a Prime Number");
            }
            else{
                console.log("It is Not Prime Number");
            }
